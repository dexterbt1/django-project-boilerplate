# django-project-boilerplate

### Usage

You might want to just download the tarball / zipfile and extract to your project repo, since you are probably just interested in the 
structure this project provides.

### Motivation

I started this repository since I'm tired of manually editing settings.py files, capturing lessons-learned 
from previous projects then porting them over to a new project. My goal is to enable rapid development by providing
a very basic generic project structure for starting Django Projects.

### TODO

- Supervisord.conf
- Dockerfile
- Vagrantfile
